## üî• Motivation

## üíª Installation

At the moment we don't provide any installation methods.
As we just started the project, we will start with providing the compiled binaries within the GitHub Releases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Lifeboat is a CLI tool which makes it possible to use it in a various kind of environments like on a local machine, in a
Unix cronjob, in Kubernetes, in a VM, wherever the user wants. As the tool needs a quite complex configuration it's
possible to provide a config file. In addition, it's also possible to provide all configuration via environment
variables.

```shell
$ lb

### Configuration

The configuration is divided in three different parts:

1. General configs
2. Source system configs
3. Destination storage configs
