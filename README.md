## üî• Motivation

## üíª Installation

At the moment we don't provide any installation methods.
As we just started the project, we will start with providing the compiled binaries with in the GitHub Releases..

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Lifeboat is a CLI tool which makes it possible to use it in a various kind of environments like on a local machine, in a Unix cronjob, in Kubernetes, in a VM, whereever the user wants.
As the tool needs a quite complex configuration it's possible to provide a config file. In addition, it's also possible to provide all configuration via environment variables.
