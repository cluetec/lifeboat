## üî• Motivation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Lifeboat is designed as a CLI tool. That allows the user to use it in a large varient of environments like on a local machine, in a unix cronjob, in kubernetes, in a VM, where ever the user wants.
As the tool needs a quite complex configuration it's possible to provide a config file. In addition it's also possible to put all configuration also in environment variables.
